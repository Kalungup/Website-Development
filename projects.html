          <h3>Curiato - Smart Bed Monitoring Platform</h3>
          <p>
            As a project manager, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work with
            Curiato, a digital health company that revolutionizes the way patients are
            monitored. Curiato's innovative smart bed monitoring platform has been designed to
            provide healthcare professionals with a new level of data insights that are used
            to inform clinical decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of the platform is the smart bed cover which collects sensor data and
            provides an accurate, real-time representation of the patient's condition. By
            leveraging the latest AI-based analytics, the platform is able to deliver
            actionable decision support, helping healthcare professionals to make informed and
            effective decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key applications of the Curiato platform is the pressure injury
            prevention, which addresses a critical and growing healthcare challenge. Pressure
            injuries are a silent epidemic that contributes to 60,000 deaths each year and
            result in longer hospital stays, higher readmissions and avoidable costs of up to
            $6 billion.

          <h3>Nort E-Commerce Project</h3>
          <p>
            As a project manager for Nort Ecommerce, I was proud to be a part of the
            development of their custom-made project using the Shopify hydrogen and oxygen
            framework, as well as the Sanity Blogging platform. This project was a true
            testament to the power of our project management expertise and the impact that it
            can have on a start-up's success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with Nort was an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only did we get to
            help bring their vision for their ecommerce platform to life, but we also had the
            opportunity to learn and grow as project managers. Our team was able to showcase
            our skills in bringing together multiple technology frameworks and making them
            work seamlessly together to provide the best possible experience for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, our team was able to demonstrate our ability to
            effectively manage timelines, budgets, and resources. We were able to ensure that
            the project was completed on time and within budget, while also delivering an
            exceptional experience to Nort's customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the highlights of this project was the opportunity to work with
            cutting-edge technologies and platforms such as Shopify and Sanity. This was a
            great learning experience, as it allowed us to expand our technical knowledge and
            stay up-to-date with the latest trends in ecommerce and web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, working on Nort's custom-made project was an incredible experience
            that we are proud to have been a part of. We are confident that our project
            management expertise and the skills we honed during this project will be
            invaluable as we continue to work with other businesses and organizations.

          <h3>EVETTI Project</h3>
          <p>
            As the project manager for the Brighter Smiles organization, I am thrilled to be
            a part of the EVETTI project, an initiative aimed at strengthening the vocational
            education and training sector in Uganda. This project is a testament to our
            commitment to fostering positive change in the textile industry, both locally and
            globally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is dedicated to bridging the gap between education and technology by
            implementing a Hybrid Learning Strategy that combines eLearning with traditional
            educational methods. The curriculum we aim to renew will be updated with the
            latest skills that match the demands of the textile industry, while incorporating
            environmental and social governance into all aspects of the supply chain. This not
            only aligns with the global mandate of the textile design profession, but also
            helps to promote social entrepreneurship and innovation in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            By working closely with our consortium partners, the Enhancing VET Textile
            Innovation (EVETTI), which consists of two universities with two scientific
            textile labs, we will be able to advance our knowledge in textile innovation and
            its role in the circular economy. The reference curriculum standards developed
            through the project will be nationalized and promoted by our project partner,
            NCDC, and shared internationally through various communication channels of each
            EVETTI partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The EVETTI project is a unique opportunity to contribute to the development of
            skills and competencies in the textile industry in Uganda, and to promote economic
            growth and expansion in the sector. We are confident that this project will help
            bridge the gap between education and the workplace by developing meaningful
            curricula for vocational training institutions. Overall, the EVETTI project is
            poised to be a major contributor to the sustainable development of the textile
            industry in Uganda and beyond.
